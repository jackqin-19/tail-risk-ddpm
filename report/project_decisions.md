# Project Decisions

## Data
- Asset pool: Scheme A
- Time range: 2015-01-01 to latest trading day
- Frequency: daily
- Return type: log return
- Note: because assets have different listing dates, default `prices.parquet`
  keeps full history (unbalanced panel). Use common-date alignment only when a
  balanced panel is explicitly required.

## Portfolio
- Equal-weight portfolio

## Tail Definition
- Loss = - portfolio return
- Tail flag if loss >= 95th percentile

## Factors
- 5-day cumulative return
- 20-day rolling volatility
- 5-day amount change
- high_vol state label

## Window
- length = 20

## Split
- Configured boundary:
  - train_end: 2022-12-31
  - valid_end: 2023-12-31
- Effective split on current common-date panel:
  - train: 2020-11-16 to 2022-12-30
  - valid: 2023-01-03 to 2023-12-29
  - test: 2024-01-02 to latest

## Model
- minimal conditional DDPM
- MLP backbone first
- tail sample weight = 3
- Implementation status: complete for C module (`model.py`, `diffusion.py`, `train.py`, `sample.py`)
